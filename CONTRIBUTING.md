# Contributing

If you find this app useful, please consider contributing to its
development. There are plenty of wish-list features in the
[bug tracker][bugtracker].

To get started, fork the repo, have a look around, and try building
the gem:

    gem build jekylljournal.gemspec

This should succeed, if not, please log a bug.

Then, find an issue (or log one) and add a comment saying that
you'd like to work on it. (So that we don't end up with duplicate
effort.)
Make some changes for whatever you're working on, and try them out
with:

    bundle exec bin/jekylljournal

Writing tests is always a good idea too.

Once it looks good, write up a [good commit message][commit].
Push to your fork and submit a pull request. Be sure to mention
the issue number you were working on in the bug tracker so that
they're linked up.
